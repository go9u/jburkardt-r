      <i>
      Plotting is a way of illustrating your data when you explain it to
      other people, but it can also be an important method for analyzing data.
      The eye can spot certain patterns in a picture that are not obvious from
      a table of numbers.  Since statistics is in part the search for patterns,
      it is necessary to have some familiarity with the kinds of plots that
      are useful in statistical analysis, and the way that the R language 
      can produce such plots.

      1: When Statistics Can Lie
    </h3>

    <p>
      Copy the data file <a href = "anscombe.csv">anscombe.csv</a>, which is a
      "CSV" (comma separated variable) file, with a header, containing a table of
      eight columns, representing 11 sets of data pairs (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3)
      and (x4,y4).
    </p>

    <p>
      1.1) Use the <b>read.csv()</b> command to read the <i>anscombe</i> dataset;
      we suggest calling the resulting R variable ``A''.
    </p>

    <p>
      1.2) We'd like to use a short name to refer to the data in each column
      of the data.  Since the first column is labeled "x1", we are allowed
      to refer to it using the name of the dataset followed by a $ sign
      and the column label.  In other words, we could print the first column
      by typing 
      <pre>
        print ( A$x1 )
      </pre>
      If you find this name a little too long, you can make a shorter name
      for each column, using commands like
      <pre>
        x1 = A$x1
        y1 = A$y1
        ...
        y4 = A$y4
      </pre>
      If you do this, then you can type the first column by the command
      <pre>
        print ( x1 )
      </pre>
      or even just
      <pre>
        x1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      1.3) We are going to try to get some numerical statistics about each
      of the columns of the dataset.  The <b>mean()</b> function gives the
      average value of a set of data, while <b>var()</b> returns the variance.
      The variance is a measure of whether the data values tend to be close
      to the average value or are spread apart.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each of the variables x1, y1, x2, ..., y4, compute and record the
      mean and variance.
      <pre>
               Mean       Variance                     Mean          Variance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    x1     |           |             |      y1     |             |             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    x2     |           |             |      y2     |             |             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    x3     |           |             |      y3     |             |             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    x4     |           |             |      y4     |             |             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      </pre>
      From these results, you may assume that the four sets of data pairs
      are very similar.
    </p>

    <p>
      1.4) Set up the linear model for each y variable as a function of the 
      corresponding x variable.  The command 
      <pre>
        lm ( y1~x1 )
      </pre>
      does this for the first data set.  Typically, the straight line will
      not go through all the data points.  The residual standard error is a 
      measure of how much the data differs from the straight line, and a quantity
      called "R-squared" reports how much of the data values can be represented
      by the straight line.  Both of these quantities can be found out by using
      the summary command, as in
      <pre>
        summary ( lm ( y1~x1 ) )
      </pre>
      Use this command for each set of data, in order to fill out the following
      table, which describes the straight line that approximates each set of data,
      and the amount by which the straight line and the data differ.
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre>
                                       Residual
                                       Standard        Multiple
               Slope       Intercept   Error           R-squared
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| lm(y1~x1) |           |             |             |             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| lm(y2~x2) |           |             |             |             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| lm(y3~x3) |           |             |             |             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| lm(y4~x4) |           |             |             |             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      1.5) For each set of data pairs, make a plot showing the data pairs
      as points, and the straight line determined by the <b>lm()</b>
      command which approximates the points.  Here are the commands for
      the first set of data:
      <pre>
        plot ( x1, y1 )
        lines ( x1, slope * x1 + intercept )
      </pre> 
      You must replace "slope" and "intercept" by the slope and
      intercept computed by the <b>lm()</b> command.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that, although the four sets of data had very similar numerical
      statistics, the plots instantly show that the data have great differences.
      In particular:
      <ol>
        <li>
          one of the datasets is well described by a straight line, but the
          straight line we computed is the wrong one!  The calculation seems
          to have been spoiled by one bad value;
        </li>
        <li>
          one of the datasets is very strange.  The straight line we computed
          does not seem to be a good representative of the actual data;
        </li>
        <li>
          one of the datasets is not well described by a straight line; the data
          seems to follow a pattern, but the pattern has a strong curve to it;
        </li>
        <li>
          one of the datasets is seems to be fairly "noisy", but the straight
          line we computed does a reasonable job of approximating the behavior.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      2: Searching for Possible Relationships
    </h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes, a set of data involves many measurements of many cases.
      For example, the data set we are about to consider involves eight
      measurements made on 32 car models, including weight, engine displacement,
      and highway mileage.  We are interested in finding relationship between
      pairs of measurements; for example, we might suspect that cars with
      greater weight tend to have lower highway mileage.  
    </p>

    <p>
      When there are many measurements in a dataset, it may be hard to know 
      which ones to try to relate.  However, the R <b>plot()</b> command, 
      which we have already used to display pairs of <b>(x,y)</b> points,
      can be used to make a quick survey of the data from which we might
      be able to spot an interesting pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Copy the data file <a href = "cars32.csv">cars32.csv</a>, which is a
      "CSV" (comma separated variable) file, with a header, containing a table of
      9 columns, including the model name and eight measurements, for 32 car models.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.1) Use the <b>read.csv()</b> command to read the dataset;
      we will assume you have called the resulting variable ``cars''.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.2) This file has a header.  To see just the header information, we can type
      <pre>
        names ( cars )
      </pre>
      which indicates that the headers are
      <pre>
[1] "Car"          "Weight"       "Length"       "Braking"     
[5] "Cylinders"    "Displacement" "City"         "Highway"     
[9] "GHG"   
      </pre>
      in particular, "Braking" is the distance the car travels when braking from a speed of
      60mph and "GHG" is the number of tons of greenhouse gases emitted by the
      car in an average year.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name of each car is stored under the first heading.  That means we can
      get a list of the names by typing
      <pre>
        cars[1]
      </pre>
      which asks for column 1 of the dataset, or by typing
      <pre>
        cars[,1]
      </pre>
      which asks for all data which is in any row, and column 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we wish to see that data for the Kia Spectra, which is in row 19 of the
      dataset, we can type
      <pre>
        cars[19,]
      </pre>
      or, if we are interested only in a single data item, say, for the 
      Chevy Malibu (row 8) we wish to know the braking distance (column 4), 
      we can type
      <pre>
        cars[8,4]
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using these ideas, what command is required to print out:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the highway mileage of all cars?
        </li>
        <li>
          all measurements for the Nissan Altima?
        </li>
        <li>
          the engine displacement of the Audi A6?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      2.3) We know that if two variables, x and y, are exactly related by a simple linear
      formula, then plotting sample pairs of (x,y) will produce points that lie
      on a straight line.  If the line rises from left to right, then x and y increase
      together; if the line falls, this means that as one variable increases, the other
      decreases.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data we will examine is unlikely to satisfy an exact linear relationship.
      However, we may be able to spot situations in which two variables seem to have
      a strong linear tendency, that is, the set of plotted points tends to form a
      straight line; if such a relationship seems to be suggested, it is also interesting
      to note whether the variables rise together or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following diagrams suggest the ways that such a plot might look, where,
      for example, the x1 axis might represent "Length" and the y1 axis "Weight"
      for the car data:
      <pre>
         +--------------------+     +----------o---------+     +--------------------+
         |             oo  o o|     |                    |     o                    |
         |           o   o    |     | o    oo            |     |o                   |
         |              o     |     |   o       o      oo|     |oooo                |
        y|       oo o         |    y|    oo o     o      |    y|o    o              |
        1|      o  o          |    2|     o         o o  |    3|  ooo  o  o         |
         |    o  ooo          |     o   o     o          |     |       o o          |
         | o  o               |     |     oo          o  |     |        o   o       |
         o   ooo              |     |             oo     |     |           o  o  o  |
         +-o------------------+     +------o-------------+     +-----------------o--+
                x1                          x2                          x3
      </pre>
      You should see that in the (x1,y1) plot, the data suggests that there is some
      relationship between x1 and y1, that it is approximately linear, and that y1 
      tends to rise as x1 does, in a linear fashion.  If x1 is the car length, and
      y1 is the car weight, then this fact is probably obvious.  But the point is,
      we didn't have to know what the variables were in order to see a relationship
      from the plot.  Meanwhile, the plot of (x2,y2) data seems to show no
      obvious pattern, while the (x3,y3) plot suggests a linear relationship in
      which y3 decreases as x3 increases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Surprisingly, R will let you plot all pairs of data against each other in
      a single plot.  You just have to use the name of the dataset in the plot
      command.  For our dataset, the command would be:
      <pre>
        plot ( cars )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This produces an 8 by 8 table of miniplots.  The miniplot in row I, column J
      uses the I-th variable for the y axis, and the J-th variable for the x axis.
      Thus, the miniplot in the second row, column
      three, represents Weight (the y axis) as a function of Length (the x axis).
      This plot seems to show an increasing linear relation between the two variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, the plot in row 2, column 4 seems to show no particular
      relationship at all.  This suggests, surprisingly, that we shouldn't expect
      that the braking distance and the weight have any obvious relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "cylinders" data is a little unusual, since it can only have the values
      4, 6, and 8.  However, it is possible even for this data to spot a roughly
      linear relationship.  Look at row 2, column 5, which plots the number of cylinders
      on the x axis, and the car weight on the y axis.  Even though the data is 
      fairly spread out, it is still possible to see that, in general, the weight
      rises in a linear fashion as the number of cylinders increases.
    </p>


    <p>
      Make a judgment, based on the plots, for each pair of data items, whether you see 
      NO relationship (0), a RISING linear relationship (+1), or a FALLING 
      linear relationship (-1).  The table below corresponds to the miniplots
      above the diagonal line on the plot.  (We don't need to look at the
      miniplots below the diagonal, since they will have essentially the
      same information, although "flipped over".)  The first few entries have
      been filled in for you.
<pre>
Weight ___+1_______  ___0________  ___+1_______  ____________  ____________  ____________  ____________
       Length        ____________  ____________  ____________  ____________  ____________  ____________

                                                 Displacement  ____________  ____________  ____________
                                                               City          ____________  ____________
                                                                             Highway       ____________  
                                                                                           GHG
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      2.4) We have already said that we detect a linear relationship between car length
      and weight.  Use the <b>lm()</b> command to determine the linear formula that
      best approximates car weight as a linear function of car length:
      <pre>
        weight = intercept + slope * length
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      2.5) Use the <b>plot()</b> command to display the car weight as a function of
      car length.  Then use the command <b>abline(intercept,slope)</b> to display
      your linear formula on the same plot.  You should expect that the line approximates
      the data well.
    </p>

      3: Estimating Probability from Frequency
    </h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes we are not looking for a relationship between two items of data, but
      rather are given the results of many repetitions of an experiment, the yearly
      record of total snowfall, the heights of every person in the sophomore class, 
      or some other measurement.  Sometimes the results may naturally group themselves,
      as when we are rolling a pair of dice, and only 11 outcomes are possible.  In
      other cases, our results might be measurements with 4 or 5 digits of accuracy,
      so that often any result occurs only once in our dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially for the case of dice, it is easy to think of the data as representing
      the observed <i>frequency</i> of each result.  For the multiple digit measurements,
      we might need to group the data into ranges before we can naturally talk about
      frequencies.  However, it is natural to assume that if we gather enough data,
      then the frequencies of events we have already observed gives us a way to estimate
      the <i>probability</i> of the occurrence of another event of the same type.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will look at the use of histograms to display and analyze frequency data,
      and consider some simple changes to the frequency plot that make it easy to
      see the underlying probabilities.  Indeed, R has a feature that allows us to
      "guess" a smooth probability curve that will describe our data in a convincing way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Copy the data file <a href = "nile.csv">nile.csv</a>, which is a
      "CSV" (comma separated variable) file, with a header, containing a year index
      and the maximum height of the Nile river at flood stage, over the course
      of 570 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.1) Use the <b>read.csv()</b> command to read the <i>nile</i> dataset;
      we suggest calling the resulting R variable ``nile''.  
    </p>

    <p>
      3.2) Use the <b>plot()</b> command to make a "scatter plot" of the "Year" variable 
      versus the "Flood" variable.  You may think that the result is almost a random
      sequence of points.  
    </p>

    <p>
      3.3) Use the <b>lines()</b> command to make a line plot of the "Year" variable 
      versus the "Flood" variable.  By connecting successive points with lines, the
      line plot gives us a little better feeling for what is going on, but there is
      really too much data here to comprehend.  In particular, we might be less interested
      in the exact history of the Nile floods and more interested in the average flood
      height and how much variation there is likely to be in this value.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.4) Since each record in our dataset represents a single measurement, we can simply
      make a histogram of the data.  For our data, this might be a two step process:
      we might first choose 11 "bins", starting with 8.5 to 9.0, then 9.0 to 9.5, and so
      on up to 13.5 to 14.0  Then we can go through our 570 data records and assign each
      value to its corresponding bin.   This gives us a frequency table, of how often
      each bin was used.  Use the R command <b>hist()</b> to create a histogram of the
      data in this way.  If you simply supply the name of the "Flood" variable as the input,
      R will automatically set up the bins, count the frequencies, and create the plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.5) It might seem that we could get more information by using smaller bins.
      R calls the number of bins "breaks", and if you don't like the number of bins R
      used, you can specify the value you want instead by adding the information 
      to the <b>plot()</b> command.  Create a new histogram of the Flood data using
      35 bins or breaks.  Notice that the bars now seem to go up and down in a somewhat
      irregular fashion.  If we increase the number of bins, this kind of behavior
      will get worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.6) It is natural to assume that if we had an "infinite" amount of data,
      our histogram bars would "behave", and we could increase the number of breaks
      as much as we wanted, and we would see a smooth curve emerging, which would
      represent the actual probability (based on our data) of each event occurring.
      R can actually approximate this feature, even though we don't have an infinite
      amount of data, by making some reasonable estimates of what is going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to illustrate this feature, we must first realize that the default histogram
      shows us a frequency plot, but that for probability we really need to divide by
      the number of data values, to get a probability estimate.  R will rescale our
      histogram for us if we simple add the switch ", freq = F" to the <b>plot()</b> command.
      Ask R to redraw the 35 breaks plot, but this time incude this new switch.
      What has changed in the plot?
    </p>

    <p>
      3.7) Now, to show how R can estimate the underlying probability pattern of the data,
      issue the command <b>lines ( density(nile$Flood) )</b>.  Assuming your histogram
      was still on the screen, your plot will now have both the probability histogram,
      plus a smooth curve that is R's model for the probability of any value of the 
      flood height, based on the finite amount of data we supplied.

      4: Using Bar Plots
    </h3>

    <p>
      The histograms we used in the previous section are sometimes confused with bar plots.
      While they are closely related, we normally think of histograms as a way to represent
      the frequency of occurrence of some kind of numerical data, so that the x-axis
      is numeric, whereas a bar plot is a set of bars whose height tells us the relative
      value of certain things, where each thing might simply be a named object.
      In this example, we will create a bar plot in which the named objects
      are a set of politicians.  Moreover, it is common to add information to
      a bar plot by dividing the bar into sub-bars, or placing several bars together
      that represent related measurements for the named object.  These features make
      bar plots significantly different from histograms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Copy the data file <a href = "republicans_2012.csv">republicans_2012.csv</a>, which is a
      "CSV" (comma separated variable) file, with a header, containing the results of a poll
      in which Republicans, Democrats and Independents were asked if they were "favorable",
      "unfavorable", "had no opinion" or "did not know the person", for each of five
      proposed candidates, who, at that time, were Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney,
      Newt Gingrich, and Oprah Winfrey.  The data file also includes a percentage for
      the Overall results, that is, averaged over all three parties.  This means the
      dataset includes 20 rows and 6 columns of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.1) Use the <b>read.csv()</b> command to read the <i>republicans_2012</i> dataset;
      we suggest calling the resulting R variable <i>rep</i>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      4.2) By typing the name of the variable, you can see that the dataset contains
      both character information (the party, and the candidate), and numeric information
      (the percentages).  The <b>barplot()</b> command only accepts numeric data,
      so it will be much easier for us if we make a copy of the numerical subset of
      the data.  The numerical subset occurs in rows 1 to 20 (in other words, all rows), 
      and columns 3 to 6.  Create a new numerical array called <i>repn</i> by using the 
      <b>as.matrix()</b> command:
      <pre>
        repn = as.matrix ( rep[1:20,3:6] )
      </pre>
      or, simply
      <pre>
        repn = as.matrix ( rep[,3:6] )
      </pre>
      Now, if you type <b>repn</b> to display this new object, it only contains
      numeric data.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.3) Row 1 of the matrix contains the favorable, unfavorable, no opinion,
      and don't know responses by Republican party members when asked about Sarah Palin.
      We can display these four numbers as bars by calling the <b>barplot()</b> function,
      and specifying that we want to display just the first row of the matrix:
      <pre>
        barplot ( repn[1,1:4] )
      </pre>
      or, simply
      <pre>
        barplot ( repn[1,] )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      4.4) Column 2 contains the unfavorable responses.  Rows 6 through 10 contain the
      unfavorable responses by Democrats when asked about each of the five candidates.
      Display these five numbers as bars:
      <pre>
        barplot ( repn[6:10,2] )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      4.5) Now we would like to make a more complicated plot, in which each bar is
      divided into pieces that represent, for each candidate, the favorable, unfavorable, 
      no opinion and don't know percentages of the responses.  Unfortunately, the easiest 
      way to make this happen requires that these four percentages be lined up in a
      <i>column</i> of the matrix, not a row!  The <b>t()</b> command in R will
      flip a numeric array in exactly the way we need.  Let's make a new copy of the
      data that has percentages as columns:
      <pre>
        rept = t ( repn )
      </pre> 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, if we wish to see in a single plot all the responses to all the candidates
      as given by Independent voters, this information is now stored in rows 1 to 4, 
      and columns 11 to 15.  And the information has the right shape for <b>barplot()</b>
      to create what are called "stacked bars":
      <pre>
        barplot ( rept[1:4,11:15] )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      4.6) In our example, the four responses were percentages that should add to 100.
      In other cases, the several values associated with each object migght be unrelated,
      and it might not make sense to stack them.  In that case, you can simply tell
      <b>barplot()</b> to display a group of bars for each object we are considering,
      by specifying that the "beside" option is TRUE:
      <pre>
        barplot ( rept[1:4,11:15], beside = T )
      </pre>
    </p>
