        It is often the case that the data you want to analyze must be prepared
        in some way before it is ready.  The problem may simply be that parts of
        your data are stored in different datasets, in which case you need to
        extract and combine them in some way.  Instead, you may find that all
        your data is available in a single file, but that there are many other
        records in that file that you want to exclude.  In this case, your task
        is to select the data of interest to you.  Another common situation occurs
        when a dataset contains multiple items of related information, which we
        want to merge before analyzing.  This is something like starting with
        a deck of 52 cards and grouping them into four separate suits.

      1: Creating a Data File, Dealing with Missing Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      When a large set of statistical measurements are compiled to form a
      single dataset, there may be cases where certain measurements are missing
      or unknown.  For instance a database of movies in which Brad Pitt had a role
      might want to list the title, year, and the amount of money made by ticket
      sales in the US market.  However, for any early movie like "Cutting
      Class", the sales information might not have been recorded, and if the
      database is being compiled in 2011, the ticket sales for the movie 
      "World War Z" will not even have started yet.  Nonetheless, it may be
      important to include both these movies in the database, even though
      their information is incomplete.  What, then, is to be done about the
      missing item of information?
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the task of entering data into R about some movies in which
      Brad Pitt had a role.  We will start by supposing we have information
      about the title, release date, budget for several movies, as follows:
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>Title</th><th>Release</th><th>Budget</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Babel</td><td>October 29, 2006</th><td>$20,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Kalifornia</td><td>September 3, 1993</th><td>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Megamind</td><td>November 5, 2010</th><td>$130,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mr and Mrs Smith</td><td>June 10, 2005</th><td>$110,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Snatch</td><td>January 19, 2000</th><td>$10,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Troy</td><td>May 14, 2004</th><td>$150,000,000</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can store this information in a datafile so that it can be
      processed by R.  Before doing so, we must note several issues:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each movie title is a single item of data; because this data
          is not a number, it must be marked off by double quotes.
          Thus, we would have <b>"Babel"</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each date is also a single item of data, and is not a number,
          so it will have to be quoted.  Also, it's probably better to
          replace the written out dates by a shortened form.  Thus,
          the release date of Babel would be <b>"10/29/2006"</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The budget is a number, but the computer does not want to see
          a dollar sign in front of the budget, and it will get confused
          by the commas that mark off millions and thousands.  The budget
          for Babel will have to be entered as <b>20000000</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we use the CSV (comma-separated-value) format for the data file,
          then each line of the file will contain a title, release date, and budget,
          separated by commas: <b>"Babel","10/29/2006",20000000</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          The first line of the CSV file usually contains names for each column
          of data.  This is where we would place the line 
          <b>"Title", "Release", "Budget"</b>.  If we include a header line
          in a CSV file, and we use <b>read.csv()</b> to read the data, then
          we will want to include the information <b>header=TRUE</b> so that
          R understands the first line is not actually data.
        </li>
        <li>
          What are we going to do about the budget for "Kalifornia"?
          R insists that there be the same number of data items on each line.
          However, if a particular data item is unknown, then R can handle
          that, as long as we use the right input format.  If the missing data
          item is a number, we simply enter a blank.  If the missing item
          would normally be a quoted string, then we enter <b>"NA"</b>.
          If a numeric data item is entered as blank, we must still put in
          the right number of commas, as though it was there!  Thus,
          the data line for "Kalifornia" should read
          </b>"Kalifornia","9/3/1993", </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      1.1) Use a text editor to create a csv file, called <i>flick.csv</i>, 
      containing the information from the above table.
    </p>

    <p>
      1.2) Start the R program, and use the <b>read.csv()</b> command to 
      read your data file, and store the result as a data frame called "flick1".  
      Use the <b>print()</b> command to verify that
      your data has been read correctly, and to see how the missing budget
      item is displayed.
    <p>

    <p>
      1.3) Now that we've entered the data, we decide that we want to include
      the distributor of each movie.  We only know the distributors for
      four of the six movies; for the other two movies, we will list the distributor
      as "NA".  Since we are adding a distributor for each movie, this is like
      adding a column to the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>Title</th><th>...</th><th>...</th><th>Distributor</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Babel</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Kalifornia</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>MGM</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Megamind</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>Dreamworks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mr and Mrs Smith</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Snatch</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>Sony</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Troy</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>Warner</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      To add this data to the data frame, we first use the 
      "combine" function <b>c()</b> to create a list of the new data.
<pre>
        Distributor <- c ( "NA", "MGM", "Dreamworks", "NA", "Sony", "Warner" )
</pre>
      Now we create a new dataframe using the <b>cbind()</b> function to append the
      Distributor column to the columns of the old data frame:
<pre>
        flick2 <- cbind ( flick1, Distributor )
</pre>
      Use the <b>print()</b> command to verify that "flick" now includes the
      Distributor information.
    </p>

    <p>
      1.4) We now wish to add information for two more movies, which is essentially
      adding two new rows to our dataframe.  The information we want to add is 
      in the following table:
    </p>

    <p>
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>Title</th><th>Release</th><th>Budget</th><th>Distributor</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ocean's Eleven</td><td>December 7, 2001</th><td>$85,000,000</td><td>Warner</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Thelma & Louise</td><td>May 24, 1991</th><td>$16,500,000</td><td>?</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding new rows to a dataframe is more awkward than adding columns, partly
      because the data along a row may be a mixture of character and numeric values.
      This means that, before we can combine the data, we have to put it into a separate
      data frame that uses the same column headings as "flick2".
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the following R commands to create a data frame containing the
      information about the two new movies.
<pre>
        Title <- c ( "Ocean's Eleven", "Thelma & Louise" )
        Release <- c ( "12/7/2001", "5/24/1991" )
        Budget <- c ( 85000000, 16500000 )
        Distributor <- c ( "Warner", "NA" )
        flick3 <- data.frame ( Title, Release, Budget, Distributor )
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we can combine the two data frames, which have the same titles and
      the same number of columns, using the <b>rbind()</b> command:
      <pre>
        flick4 <- rbind ( flick2, flick3 );
      </pre>
      Use the <b>print()</b> command to verify that the data frame "flick4"
      contains all the information.
    </p>

    <p>
      1.5) Save a copy of the updated <i>flick4</i> data frame as a CSV file, by
      using the <b>write.csv()</b> command:
      <pre>
        write.csv ( flick4, file = "flick4.csv" )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      2: Selecting Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      Suppose we have a large set of data about movies, including such information
      as titles, distributor, budget, and gross sales.  Since several hundred movies
      are released each year, it's useful to be able to select a particular subset
      of this information for analysis or graphical display.  
    </p>

    <p>
      2.1) This part of the lab requires that you start by copying a small CSV file 
      called <a href = "http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/r_src/select_lab/brad_pitt.csv">brad_pitt.csv</a>.  Now start R and use 
      the <b>read.csv()</b> command to read the file.
      This file includes header information, so be sure to read that correctly.
      Store the result as the data frame <i>pitt</i>, and use the <b>print()</b>
      command to verify that the data was read correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.2) The data frame <i>pitt</i> contains all the information from the file.
      If we simply type <b>pitt</b>, R will print out this information.  We will now
      look at ways of having R display only a portion of this information,
      using <i>bracket notation</i>:
<pre>
         <i>optional name</i> <- <i>data frame</i> [ <i>rows</i>, <i>columns</i> ] 
</pre>
      Here <i>rows</i> and <i>columns</i> are information that selects the rows
      and columns we want.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, we can select data if we know the numeric index of a row or column.
      To see row 1 (and all its columns):
<pre>
        pitt [ 1, ] 
</pre>
      To select all rows, but just column 2:
<pre>
        pitt [ , 2 ]
</pre>
      and to select row 3, column 4:
<pre>
        pitt [ 3, 4 ]
</pre>
      To "select" the entire set of data, we can type
<pre>
         pitt [ , ] 
</pre>
      although, of course, in this case we could have simply said <b>pitt</b>!
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than selecting a single row or column, we can use R's colon
      notation.  Remember that <b>3:7</b> means 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, so we can
      ask for rows 3 to 7 by
<pre>
         pitt [ 3:7, ] 
</pre>
      If the indices we want are not sequential, we can use the <b>c()</b>
      command to form a list.  Thus, if we're interested in rows 2, 3, 7 
      and 11, the expression <b>c(2,3,7,11)</b> makes this a single list,
      and we can display exactly those rows, and just the title (in column 1) by
<pre>
         pitt [ c(2,3,7,11), 1 ] 
</pre>
      Similarly, if we wanted to print just the 
      gross receipts (column 3) followed by the title (column 1) for
      movies 9, 10, and 11, we could use the command
<pre>
         pitt [ 9:11, c(3,1) ] 
</pre>
      Notice that the column data appears in exactly the order we requested.
      <i>What do you think would happen if we specified c(3,1,3) for the columns?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we often don't want to select a row or column by its index,
      but rather because of some property that the item has.  Perhaps we
      want to list the titles of all movies made in 1997.  R allows us
      to do this using the bracket notation, but now we have to specify
      the rows we want.  The column containing the movie year is called
      <i>Year</i>.  You can print all the year information in the <i>pitt</i>
      dataframe by typing
<pre>
         pitt$Year
</pre>
      You can ask which movies came out in 1997 by writing
<pre>
         pitt$Year == 1997
</pre>
      Note that we need <b>two</b> equal signs when we are not assigning
      a value, but looking for occurrences of a value!
      Notice that this command produces a list of TRUE and FALSE values.
      If we use this command as a row selector, R will display exactly
      those movies that came out in 1997!
<pre>
         pitt [ pitt$Year == 1997, 1 ]
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some examples of selections we could make, assuming that
      we are dealing with a numeric variable:
      <ul>
        <li>
          pitt$Year == 1997<i>, movies made in 1997;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          pitt$Year != 1997<i>, movies <b>not</b> made in 1997;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          pitt$Year < 1997<i>, movies made before 1997;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          pitt$Year <= 1997<i>, movies made in 1997 or earlier;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          pitt$Year > 1997<i>, movies made after 1997;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          pitt$Year => 1997<i>, movies made in 1997 or later;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          pitt$Year == 1997 | pitt$Year == 2000<i>, movies made in
          1997 <b>or</b> 2000;</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          1997 <= pitt$Year & pitt$Year < 2000<i>, movies made
          from 1997 up to, but not including, 2000.</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      2.3) We would like to select the movies that Brad Pitt made between 1995
      and 2000.  The data frame stores the year as the variable <i>pitt$Year</i>.
      A movie was made on or after 1995 if it is true that:
<pre>
        1995 <= pitt$Year
</pre>
      A movie was made between 1995 and 2000 if it is true that:
<pre>
        1995 <= pitt$Year & pitt$Year <= 2000
</pre>
      We can use this logical expression to select the rows we want;
      for now, we will suppose that all the column information is interesting to us.
      The format of the command we want to use is
<pre>
        <i>new dataframe</i> <- <i>old dataframe</i> [ <i>rows</i>, <i>columns</i> ]
</pre>
      so, to select from <i>pitt</i> the rows (movies) in the given year range,
      we type:
<pre>
        pitt2 <- pitt [ 1995 <= pitt$Year & pitt$Year <= 2000,  ]
</pre>
      Notice the comma in the above command; it separates the row selection (range
      of years) from the column selection (which we did not use).
    </p>

    <p>
      2.4) Now we want to consider movies made after 2007,
      and we only want to list the title (column 1) and gross receipts
      (column 3).  <i>What form of the bracket command will display title and gross
      for just these 9 movies?</i>
<pre>
        pitt [ ?, ? ]
</pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      3: Dealing with Missing Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      We'd like to print and plot the data in the gross receipts column of the
      data file.  However, note that this column has many <b>NA</b> entries,
      either because the data has been lost over time, or because the movie hadn't
      actually been released when the data file was created.  The NA values
      work fine when we print information.  But how is R going to handle them
      when we try to select or plot information?
    </p>

    </p>
      3.1) To try to get an idea of whether there will be a problem, let's
      use the bracket notation, and ask for a list of all movies for which
      the gross receipts were more than $150,000,000.  If you check the
      data first, by using the <b>print()</b> command, you will see that
      there are just two such movies, "Mr and Mrs Smith" and "Ocean's Eleven".
      Let's try asking R this question:
<pre>
        pitt [ 150000000 <= pitt$Gross, ]
</pre>
      Unfortunately, we see the two movies we want, but also every movie for
      which the gross receipt information has the NA value.  
    </p>

    <p>
      If we are interested in gross receipts, then the records for which no
      such information is available are of no interest to us.  And it looks as
      though our selection commands won't work properly when NA data is involved.
      What can we do?
    </p>

    <p>
      3.2) The right approach is to make a copy of the data frame that drops
      those records that don't have gross receipts information.  In other words,
      we want to make a new data frame by selecting those records for which
      the gross receipts are not "NA".  To ask if a number is an NA, we write
<pre>
        is.na ( <i>number</i> )
</pre>
      To ask if a number is <b>not</b> an NA, we write
<pre>
        !is.na ( <i>number</i> )
</pre>
      To ask if the number <i>pitt$Gross</i> is not an NA, we write
<pre>
        !is.na ( pitt$Gross )
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Make a new data frame, called <i>pitt2</i>, containing the records for which
      gross receipt information is available, by typing
<pre>
        pitt2 <- pitt [ !is.na ( pitt$Gross), ]
 </pre>
      The <b>print()</b> command can be used to verify that your command
      selected the correct data.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.3) Now repeat your question, asking which movies had gross receipts
      of $150,000,000 or more, but ask it about the <i>pitt2</i> data frame!
      If you ask this question correctly, you see exactly two movies listed.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.4) Use the <b>barplot()</b> command on the <i>pitt2</i> gross receipts
      data to illustrate the hits and flops.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      4: Grouping Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      4.1) This part of the lab requires that you start by copying a large CSV file 
      called <a href = "http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/r_src/select_lab/movies_2010.csv">movies_2010.csv</a>.  Now start R and use 
      the <b>read.csv()</b> command to read this file into the data frame "movie1".
      This file includes header information, so be sure to read that correctly.
      Since the file is large, don't use the <b>print()</b> command!  Instead, 
      try the <b>summary()</b> command.  The first column is labeled "Rank", 
      and you should see that it runs from 1 to 670; indeed, there are 670 movies 
      in this file.
    </p>

      4.2) Suppose we want to look at the gross receipts for movies distributed
      by IFC Films.  That means we want to look at movies based on the "Distributor" 
      field.  However, as the <b>summary()</b> command indicates, there are 39 movies
      for which the "Distributor" is listed as "NA".  R has trouble working with
      NA data, so our first task is to make a new dataframe containing only the 
      movies for which "Distributor" is not "NA".
    </p>

    <p>
      The movies (rows) we want to select are those for which the distributor is
      <b>not</b> an NA value.  So we are looking at the <i>movie1</i> dataframe,
      at column <i>Distributor</i>, and we want to select those rows for which
      this value is not NA.  R uses the function <b>is.na()</b> to report that
      a value is NA; an exclamation mark reverses this check, so that we are
      picking up the non-NA values:
      <pre>
        movie2 <- movie1 [ !is.na ( movie1$Distibutor ), ]
      </pre>
      Use the <b>summary()</b> command on the <i>movie2</i> data frame. Under the
      Distributor heading, there should be no NA values.  If you look closely at
      the Title heading, you should be able to see that there are now 631 movies 
      in the new data frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.3) Now that the Distributor column is cleaned up, we can make a new
      data frame that selects movies based on the Distibutor value.  In particular,
      we could pick out movies distributed by IFC Films:
      <pre>
        movie3 <- movie2 [ movie2$Distributor == "IFC Films", ]
      </pre>
      Here, the <b>summary()</b> command should show 33 films in the new data frame;
      the highest ranking movie came in at 182.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.4) Since there are just a few movies in this data frame, use the <b>print()</b>
      command to report the information for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.5) Use the <b>barplot()</b> command to plot the gross receipts for each of
      the movies distributed by IFC Films.  This plot should suggest that IFC Films
      had just two moderately successful films (gross more than $1,000,000) while
      the remaining films typically had gross receipts of around $500,000 or less.
