      CSV_IO <br> Reading or Writing Comma Separated Value (CSV) Files in R
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CSV_IO</b> contains R programs which
      illustrate how one can read or write comma separated value (CSV) files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Briefly, R includes a special command <b>read.csv()</b> specifically for reading CSV files:
      <pre>
        <i>name</i> &lt;- <b>read.csv</b> ( "<i>filename.csv</i>",
          <b>header</b> = TRUE <i>or</i> FALSE ) 
      </pre>
      or, the more general <b>read.table()</b> function can be used:
      <pre>
        <i>name</i> &lt;- <b>read.table</b> ( "<i>filename.csv</i>",
          <b>header</b> = TRUE <i>or</i> FALSE,
          <b>sep</b> = "," <i>or</i> <b>sep</b> = " " <i>or</i> <b>sep</b>= "\t" ) 
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest example of a comma separated value file involves numeric
      data, with the same number of values occurring on each row.  Thus, we might
      have three rows of data, each containing 10 values, with successive values
      separated by commas (which R specifies by <b>sep</b>=","):
      <pre>
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20
21,22,23,24,25,26.27.28.29,30
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Variations on this approach use the TAB character (which R specifies by <b>sep</b>="\t")
      to separate the values:
      <pre>
1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18	19	20
21	22	23	24	25	26	27	28	29	30
      </pre>
      or one or more spaces (which R specifies by <b>sep</b>=" ":
      <pre>
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes the first row of a CSV file is used to give labels to the columns.
      In this case, the command to read the file should specify <b>header</b>=TRUE:
      <pre>
        "Age", "Weight in Pounds"
        0,  8.4
        1, 16.8
        2, 24.5
        3, 37.0
        4, 49.0
        5, 63.0
      </pre>

    <p>
      A <b>data frame</b> is a table of data that may include row or column labels as well.
      For instance, the <b>FAMILY</b> example defines a data frame of 4 properties of
      7 individuals, which can be represented as the following table, where items in
      <b>bold face</b> are labels:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th><th>First name</th><th>Age</th><th>Height (inches)</th><th>Weight (pounds)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Dad</th><td>Horace</td><td>45</td><td>71</td><td>230</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Mom</th><td>Gladys</td><td>43</td><td>66</td><td>158</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Big Bro</th><td>Marco</td><td>22</td><td>73</td><td>190</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Big Sis</th><td>Desiree</td><td>20</td><td>69</td><td>150</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Me</th><td>Arnold</td><td>17</td><td>69</td><td>165</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Punk Sis</th><td>Darleen</td><td>15</td><td>67</td><td>120</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Dog</th><td>Blotch</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>15</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      If this data frame is written to a CSV file, the first row of the file 
      contains column labels, and the subsequent rows each begin with the row label followed
      by the data for that row.

      Examples and Tests:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>PLAYERS</b> is an example involving the highest salaried football players.
      The data includes first and last name, team, position, and salary, for 5 players.
      The file includes an initial row of column labels.  The data is separated by commas.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "create_players.R">create_players.R</a>, 
          defines the data and assigns it to a data frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "write_players.R">write_players.R</a>, 
          writes the data frame to the file "players.csv".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "read_players.R">read_players.R</a>, 
          reads the data frame from the file "players.csv".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "players.csv">players.csv</a>, 
          the comma separated value file containing the player information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "players_output.txt">players_output.txt</a>, 
          the output file created by executing create_players.R,
          write_players.R and read_players.R.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>NUMBERS</b> is an example in which no column or row labels are used, and
      all the data is numeric, consisting of 3 rows of 10 numbers.  The basic file
      uses commas to separate the data, but two related files use tabs or spaces
      instead.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "numbers.csv">numbers.csv</a>, 
          the comma separated value file containing the numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "numbers_tab.csv">numbers_tab.csv</a>, 
          the tab separated value file containing the numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "numbers_space.csv">numbers_space.csv</a>, 
          the space separated value file containing the numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "read_numbers.R">read_numbers.R</a>, 
          reads and prints the data from all three files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "numbers_output.txt">numbers_output.txt</a>, 
          the output file created by executing read_numbers.R.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FAMILY</b> is an example in which column and row labels are used.
      In fact, the default labels used by R are replaced by user-chosen values.
      The values and labels are written to the CSV file, and read back.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "create_family.R">create_family.R</a>, 
          defines the data, assigns it to a data frame,
          and replaces the default row and column labels by user-chosen values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "write_family.R">write_family.R</a>, 
          writes the data frame to the file "family.csv".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "read_family.R">read_family.R</a>, 
          reads the data frame from the file "family.csv".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "family.csv">family.csv</a>, 
          the comma separated value file containing the data, as well as
          row and column labels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "family_output.txt">family_output.txt</a>, 
          the output file created by executing create_family.R,
          write_family.R and read_family.R.
        </li>
      </ul>
